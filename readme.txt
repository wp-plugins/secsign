== Description ==

SecSign ID - The mobile way to log into web sites


SecSign ID is a plugin for real two-factor authentication (2FA) for Wordpress sites. 2FA adds another layer of security to your website by using a second token. In this case the physical token is your smartphone. 
If you seek for more information about about two-factor authentication have a look at [secsign.com](https://www.secsign.com/two-factor-authentication/).


* Integrate SecSign ID into your own WordPress site in less than one minute.
* You and your users can also use SecSign ID to visit securely other web sites (e.g. [portal.secsign.com](https://portal.secsign.com) for truly professional messaging and cloud sharing.)
* This service is free for users and web site owners and free of advertising - no matter how many users the web site has.
* You can also integrate SecSign ID as in-house solution into your existing infrastructure (on request with licensed service and maintenance contract)

== Installation ==

= Install the Plugin =

* Login into WordPress as admin, go to the plugins screen and select the "Add New" submenu.
* Search for "SecSign" and click "Install Now" or click on "Upload" and select the downloaded zip archive.
* Activate the plugin in the "Installed Plugins" list.

= Note =

The SecSign ID WordPress plugin uses the [SecSign ID API](https://github.com/SecSign/secsign-php-api). The API requests from the SecSign ID server a so-called access pass (a session and a pass icon) which must be confirmed on the smartphone. In order to enable the plugin to establish a connection to the SecSign ID server, the curl packet (http://php.net/manual/de/book.curl.php) must be installed for PHP, and the web server on which the WordPress site is running must be able to reach the SecSign ID server under https://httpapi.secsign.com. Otherwise, you have to make changes in the settings for firewall and/or proxy.

= Add the Login Widget =

* You can add the SecSignID login widget to your site to allow the login on, for example, the side menu.
* Go to the "Appearance" screen and click on the "Widgets" submenu.
* Drag and drop the "SecSign ID Login" widget to, for example, the "Main Sidebar"

= General Configuration =

* Go to the "Settings" screen and select the "SecSign ID Login" submenu.
* Change the service address which will be shown to the user in the smartphone app. This should match the URL the users will see, when visiting your site.

= Co-worker Configuration =

* You can integrate the SecSign ID login on the wp-login.php page. This is done by default.
* Optionally, you can assign SecSign IDs to the WordPress users of your co-workers (admins, editors, authors and contributors). The users themselves can also assign a SecSign ID in their profile.
* You can also deactivate the normal password-based login for the users, so they can only login using the SecSign ID. It’s recommended that you deactivate the password login for all co-workers, so your site is secured against brute force attacks. You should only allow the password-based login for your own admin account, in case you lose your phone, and of course for all co-workers without smartphones. These accounts should be secured using a very strong password.

= User Configuration =

* Optionally, you can assign SecSign IDs to the WordPress users of your website users (subscribers). The users themselves can also assign a SecSign ID in their profile.
* It’s also possible to activate and deactivate the password-based login for your users.

= Fast Registration =

* In order not to have to create new user accounts yourself you can allow your co-workers or web site users to create user accounts themselves by logging in with their SecSign ID via wp-login.php or the login widget. You can allow them to create a new wordpress user or assign an existing one. After they created an wordpress account, you can assign wordpress roles to your co-workers via the user administration.
